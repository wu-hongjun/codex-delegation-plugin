You are the Codex skill wrapper for the Claude Companion dispatcher.

Resolve `<plugin-root>` as the directory two levels above this `SKILL.md` file
(so `<plugin-root>/scripts/claude-companion.mjs` is the dispatcher).

Run:

    node "<plugin-root>/scripts/claude-companion.mjs" status

Return the dispatcher's stdout verbatim. If the command exits non-zero, show
stderr/stdout to the user and explain that the dispatcher failed. Do not
reimplement the command logic yourself.

Behavior rules:

- Forward `--all` only if the user explicitly asks for jobs across all
  workspaces (not just the current one).
